# A Guide to Choosing Power Supplies for LED Lighting
### Ensuring Long-Term Performance, Safety, and Efficiency – From Onco Solutions

The **power supply** is the backbone of any **LED lighting system**. While LEDs are inherently energy-efficient, their full potential can only be realized with a **correctly specified, properly installed, and precisely regulated power supply unit (PSU)**.

At **Onco Solutions**, we ensure that every lighting installation – whether it’s for a hotel, showroom, façade, or boardroom – begins with a rock-solid power supply strategy. Here's how to choose the right one.

## 🔌 What Is an LED Power Supply?

An LED power supply (also known as an **LED driver**) converts **standard mains voltage (230V AC)** into a lower voltage **DC output** (typically 12V or 24V) suitable for powering LED fixtures. It also regulates the current to ensure optimal and safe LED operation.

## 🔍 Key Considerations When Choosing an LED Power Supply

### 1. Output Voltage vs. Output Current (Constant Voltage vs. Constant Current)

- **Constant Voltage (CV)** Drivers:  
  - Used with LEDs designed for a specific voltage (e.g., 12V or 24V)  
  - Ideal for **LED strips, linear lights**, and architectural runs  
  - Must match the voltage rating of the connected LED load

- **Constant Current (CC)** Drivers:  
  - Supply a fixed current (e.g., 350mA, 700mA)  
  - Voltage varies to maintain consistent current  
  - Ideal for **high-power LEDs, downlights**, or fixtures requiring regulated drive

> 🔧 **At Onco Solutions**, we perform load calculations to determine whether your lighting configuration demands CV or CC supplies – especially critical in large installations.

### 2. Power Rating (Wattage Capacity)

Always choose a PSU with **20–30% more capacity** than the actual load to ensure:
- Better thermal management  
- Longer lifespan  
- Headroom for system expansion

> Example: For a 48W LED load, a 60W PSU offers optimal performance without stress.

### 3. Dimming Compatibility

If you're integrating **smart lighting control systems** like **Dynalite**, **C-Bus**, or **DALI**, your power supply must support:
- **0–10V dimming**
- **PWM dimming**
- **TRIAC or phase-cut dimming**
- **DALI/DIGITAL protocols**

> Failure to match the dimming protocol with your control system leads to flicker, uneven dimming, or total incompatibility.

### 4. Environmental Factors (IP Rating, Heat Dissipation)

For outdoor, façade, or wet-area lighting:
- Use **IP65/IP67** rated water-resistant power supplies  
- Choose metal enclosures with proper **heat sinks** for thermal stability

> Onco Solutions only sources power supplies from **globally certified brands** to ensure durability in Sri Lanka’s tropical climate conditions.

### 5. Voltage Drop Management

For long LED runs (especially linear installations or outdoor strips), voltage drop becomes a serious concern. We mitigate this by:
- Using **higher voltage systems** (24V vs. 12V)  
- Incorporating **multiple injection points**  
- Carefully calculating **cable gauge and run length**

> Our team at Onco provides full voltage drop assessments during system design.

### 6. Certifications and Protections

Reputable LED power supplies include:
- **Overload protection**  
- **Short-circuit protection**  
- **Over-voltage and thermal shutdown**  
- Certifications like **CE, RoHS, UL, TUV, or BIS**

This ensures **safety**, especially in **hospitals, hospitality environments**, and **public buildings**.

## 🔧 Onco’s Engineering Approach

At Onco Solutions, we don’t guess – we engineer.

We:
- Audit your entire lighting load  
- Determine dimming/control requirements  
- Calculate voltage drops  
- Specify high-efficiency, long-lifetime PSUs  
- Ensure physical layout, wiring, and thermal management are aligned with international best practices

## 🏆 Preferred Applications

- **Architectural lighting** (linear, cove, façade): Requires stable CV PSUs  
- **Boardroom & hotel dimming**: Needs DALI-compliant, flicker-free drivers  
- **Showrooms & galleries**: Require high CRI, low-noise dimmable drivers  
- **Outdoor installations**: IP67, surge-protected power supplies

## Final Thought: Your LED System Is Only as Good as Its Power Supply

Cutting corners on power supplies results in:
- Flickering  
- Shorter LED lifespan  
- Overheating  
- Dimming malfunctions  
- Risk of electrical failure

Choosing the right power supply means choosing **longevity, efficiency, and safety**.
