## Why Smart Lighting for Hospitality Spaces?

In today's hospitality industry, guest expectations are evolving rapidly. Personalized comfort, intuitive technology, and eco-friendly practices are no longer optional — they are essential. Onco Solutions empowers you to meet these demands with smart lighting solutions that deliver measurable benefits:

- Touchless and voice-activated controls available  
- Mobile app or bedside panel control options  
- Personalized lighting settings remembered for repeat guests  

### ✨ Achieve Energy Efficiency and Sustainability
