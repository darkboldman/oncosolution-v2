### Get the Best from Your Smart Lighting System – With Onco Solutions

Smart lighting is only as smart as the sensors behind it. Whether you’re using **motion detectors, daylight sensors, or occupancy sensors**, accurate **calibration** is essential for performance, efficiency, and reliability.

At **Onco Solutions**, we help businesses, hotels, and homeowners across Sri Lanka fine-tune their lighting systems to respond intelligently to real-world conditions. Here’s our expert guide to understanding and calibrating sensors correctly.

## 🔧 Why Sensor Calibration Matters

Incorrectly calibrated sensors can cause:
- Lights to turn on/off too frequently or at the wrong times  
- Wasted energy and increased costs  
- Poor user experience or discomfort  
- Shortened product lifespan

Proper calibration ensures that your **lighting responds only when it should**, creating **efficiency, comfort, and professionalism** in every space.

## 🔍 Types of Sensors We Calibrate

1. **PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensors** – Detect body heat and movement  
2. **Ultrasonic Motion Sensors** – Detect presence through sound waves  
3. **Occupancy Sensors** – Determine if a room is in use  
4. **Daylight or Lux Sensors** – Measure natural light to adjust brightness  
5. **Touchless IR/Gesture Sensors** – Enable no-contact controls  
6. **Photocells & Ambient Light Sensors** – Control outdoor and façade lighting

Each type requires specific calibration for optimal results — especially in changing environments like hotel rooms, boardrooms, showrooms, or exterior lighting.

## 📏 Step-by-Step Calibration Guide

### ✅ 1. Understand the Environment
Every room has different variables:
- Natural light levels  
- Ceiling height  
- Reflective surfaces  
- Furniture or partitions  
- Typical occupancy patterns

Start by identifying **sensor placement zones** and **light behavior expectations**.

### ✅ 2. Set Sensitivity Levels
For motion and occupancy sensors:
- Too high = lights may stay on from hallway activity  
- Too low = lights may turn off while someone is working still

Set the **motion detection range and trigger delay** to match real usage patterns.

### ✅ 3. Adjust Light Thresholds
Daylight or lux sensors should:
- Turn artificial lights **off when there’s sufficient sunlight**  
- Keep lights **on during cloudy or shaded conditions**

Calibrate thresholds during daytime using a **lux meter**, and test with **blinds open vs. closed**.

### ✅ 4. Configure Timer Settings
Most sensors allow a **delay time** (e.g., 2 minutes to 30 minutes) before switching off lights after no activity.

We recommend:
- **Short delay (2–5 min)** in washrooms and corridors  
- **Longer delay (10–15 min)** in meeting rooms or hotel guest areas

### ✅ 5. Field Test with Real Users
Always test calibration with actual users in the space:
- Walk into the zone  
- Remain still for periods  
- Measure daylight changes

Fine-tune based on feedback from facility managers or occupants.

## 🛠️ Pro Tip from Onco:
> In multi-sensor systems (like C-Bus or Dynalite), sensors can work together. For example, an **occupancy sensor + daylight sensor** may both need to agree before lights are activated.

We configure and program these conditions through the **lighting control system**, not just the sensor device.
