# What Really Matters in Boardroom Lighting
### Creating Effective, Automated Meeting Spaces ‚Äì From Onco Solutions

The boardroom is more than just a table and chairs ‚Äî it‚Äôs where ideas are presented, deals are made, and leadership happens. Lighting in such an environment needs to balance **professionalism, comfort, technology, and functionality**.

At **Onco Solutions**, we specialize in **automated lighting solutions** that turn boardrooms and meeting areas into **intelligent, adaptable, and impressive spaces**.

## üí° The Purpose of Boardroom Lighting

A well-lit boardroom:
- Enhances focus and productivity
- Creates a welcoming and professional atmosphere
- Supports presentations, video calls, and collaboration
- Reflects your brand and attention to detail

## ‚úÖ What Really Matters in Boardroom Lighting

### 1. **Layered Lighting**
Good lighting design includes:
- **Ambient light** ‚Äì soft general illumination
- **Task lighting** ‚Äì focused light on tables or documents
- **Accent lighting** ‚Äì highlighting features like artwork or logos

> A layered approach prevents glare, shadows, and fatigue.

### 2. **Dimmable Fixtures**
Adjust lighting levels based on:
- Time of day
- Presentation needs
- Screen use (reduce glare during projections)

Dimming improves **visual comfort** and **energy efficiency**.

### 3. **Automated Scenes**
Set pre-programmed scenes for:
- **Presentation Mode** ‚Äì dims ambient, boosts screen light
- **Meeting Mode** ‚Äì balanced brightness
- **Video Call Mode** ‚Äì front-lit for faces, avoids backlighting
- **Idle Mode** ‚Äì energy-saving standby

Controlled via:
- **Wall-mounted keypads**
- **Touch panels**
- **Mobile apps**
- **Motion sensors**

### 4. **Sensor Integration**
Occupancy and daylight sensors:
- Turn lights on/off automatically
- Adjust brightness based on natural light
- Reduce energy consumption when room is unused

### 5. **Color Temperature Matters**
Use **neutral white (4000K)** for clarity and professionalism.  
Avoid very warm or very cool tones that distort visuals or cause discomfort.

### 6. **Aesthetic and Acoustic Fixtures**
Today‚Äôs boardrooms benefit from:
- **Linear LED fixtures** that double as design elements
- **Acoustic lighting** that controls sound while illuminating
- **Suspended lighting** for open ceilings
