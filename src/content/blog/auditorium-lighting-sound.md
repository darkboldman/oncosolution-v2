## <span class="material-icons">light_mode</span> The Role of Lighting in Auditoriums

### <span class="material-icons">visibility</span> 1. Enhancing Visibility and Focus

From stage performances to lectures and presentations, lighting directs attention. A proper setup:

- Illuminates presenters and performers effectively  
- Highlights focal areas without glare or dark spots  
- Offers smooth transitions between scenes or modes (lecture, drama, concert)  

---

### <span class="material-icons">theater_comedy</span> 2. Creating Mood and Atmosphere

Lighting sets the tone for performances and events. The right color, temperature, and intensity:

- Elevate emotional impact in drama or music  
- Support theme-based lighting for events and conferences  
- Encourage audience engagement and immersion  

---

### <span class="material-icons">flash_auto</span> 3. Supporting Flexibility

Modern auditoriums are multipurpose. Good lighting design includes:

- **Scene presets** for quick switching between modes  
- **Zoned lighting** to control different sections (stage, audience, aisles)  
- **Dimmable and programmable LEDs** for creative control

## <span class="material-icons">graphic_eq</span> The Role of Sound in Auditoriums

### <span class="material-icons">volume_up</span> 1. Speech Intelligibility and Music Clarity

The ultimate goal of any sound system is **clarity**. Whether it's a school speech or a live band:

- Sound must reach every seat evenly  
- Audio should be clear without echo, distortion, or delay  
- Microphones and speakers must be matched to the acoustics of the room  

---

### <span class="material-icons">settings_input_component</span> 2. Customized Acoustic Design

No two auditoriums are the same. A professional sound design takes into account:

- Room dimensions, materials, and reverberation  
- Stage size and speaker placement  
- Type of use: speeches, concerts, multimedia presentations, etc.  

Proper acoustic treatment and speaker calibration ensures that sound doesn’t get lost—or overpower the space.

### <span class="material-icons">engineering</span> 3. Reliability and Ease of Use

A system is only as good as its usability. Onco Solutions provides:

- **User-friendly control interfaces**  
- **Wireless mic setups**, podium mics, and stage monitors  
- Backup systems for power outages or technical issues  
- Training and support for your staff  

---

## <span class="material-icons">integration_instructions</span> The Value of Integrated AV Design

A holistic lighting and sound design avoids conflicts and enhances synchronization.

### Why integration matters:

- Lighting cues can be timed with sound effects or music  
- Centralized control reduces complexity  
- Both systems are aligned to the venue’s purpose, usage, and audience size  

Onco Solutions designs AV systems that **work in harmony**, not in isolation.
