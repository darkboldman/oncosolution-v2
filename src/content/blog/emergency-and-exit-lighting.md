When the unexpected happens—like a power failure, fire, or natural disaster—**emergency lighting becomes a lifeline**. In public spaces such as schools, theaters, malls, offices, and auditoriums, people depend on **clearly visible exit signs and illuminated pathways** to guide them to safety.

At **Onco Solutions**, we specialize in designing and implementing **reliable, code-compliant emergency lighting systems** for all types of public and commercial facilities in **Sri Lanka**.

## <span class="material-icons">report_problem</span> Why Emergency Lighting Matters

A blackout or emergency event can lead to panic and disorientation. Emergency lighting:

- Provides **critical illumination** when the main power fails  
- **Reduces risk** of falls, injuries, and stampedes  
- Guides people safely to **emergency exits**  
- Assists **first responders** in navigating the building  
- Helps **ensure compliance** with safety regulations

## <span class="material-icons">exit_to_app</span> The Role of Exit and Route Indication Lighting

**Exit signs and route indicators** are not just accessories—they are mandatory safety systems that save lives.

Properly implemented systems should:

- Be **illuminated and visible** from any point in the building  
- **Clearly mark all exits and evacuation routes**  
- Function **independently of main power** via battery backup  
- Comply with **local fire and building codes**

## <span class="material-icons">engineering</span> Key Features of an Effective Emergency Lighting System

To serve their purpose, emergency lighting systems must be:

- **Automatically activated** during a power failure  
- Equipped with **self-contained batteries** or connected to backup power  
- Designed to **illuminate key areas** such as corridors, staircases, lobbies, and exits  
- Rated for **minimum illumination duration** (often 1–3 hours)  
- Routinely **tested and maintained**
