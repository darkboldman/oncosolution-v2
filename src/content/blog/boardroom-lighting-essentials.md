# Creating Effective, Automated Meeting Spaces – From Onco Solutions

The boardroom is more than just a table and chairs — it’s where ideas are presented, deals are made, and leadership happens. Lighting in such an environment needs to balance professionalism, comfort, technology, and functionality.

At Onco Solutions, we specialize in automated lighting solutions that turn boardrooms and meeting areas into intelligent, adaptable, and impressive spaces.

## <span class="material-icons">meeting_room</span> The Purpose of Boardroom Lighting

A well-lit boardroom:

- Enhances focus and productivity  
- Creates a welcoming and professional atmosphere  
- Supports presentations, video calls, and collaboration  
- Reflects your brand and attention to detail  

## <span class="material-icons">fact_check</span> What Really Matters in Boardroom Lighting

### 1. Layered Lighting

Good lighting design includes:

- **Ambient light** – soft general illumination  
- **Task lighting** – focused light on tables or documents  
- **Accent lighting** – highlighting features like artwork or logos  

A layered approach prevents glare, shadows, and fatigue.

### 2. Dimmable Fixtures

Adjust lighting levels based on:

- Time of day  
- Presentation needs  
- Screen use (reduce glare during projections)  

Dimming improves visual comfort and energy efficiency.

### 3. Automated Scenes

Set pre-programmed scenes for:

- **Presentation Mode** – dims ambient, boosts screen light  
- **Meeting Mode** – balanced brightness  
- **Video Call Mode** – front-lit for faces, avoids backlighting  
- **Idle Mode** – energy-saving standby  

Controlled via:

- Wall-mounted keypads  
- Touch panels  
- Mobile apps  
- Motion sensors  

### 4. Sensor Integration

Occupancy and daylight sensors:

- Turn lights on/off automatically  
- Adjust brightness based on natural light  
- Reduce energy consumption when room is unused  

### 5. Color Temperature Matters

- Use **neutral white (4000K)** for clarity and professionalism.  
- Avoid very warm or very cool tones that distort visuals or cause discomfort.  

### 6. Aesthetic and Acoustic Fixtures

Today’s boardrooms benefit from:

- Linear LED fixtures that double as design elements  
- Acoustic lighting that controls sound while illuminating  
- Suspended lighting for open ceilings
