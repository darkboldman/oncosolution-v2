# Ensuring Long-Term Performance, Safety, and Efficiency ‚Äì From Onco Solutions

The power supply is the backbone of any LED lighting system. While LEDs are inherently energy-efficient, their full potential can only be realized with a correctly specified, properly installed, and precisely regulated power supply unit (PSU).

At Onco Solutions, we ensure that every lighting installation ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs for a hotel, showroom, fa√ßade, or boardroom ‚Äì begins with a rock-solid power supply strategy. Here's how to choose the right one.

## üîå What Is an LED Power Supply?

An LED power supply (also known as an LED driver) converts standard mains voltage (230V AC) into a lower voltage DC output (typically 12V or 24V) suitable for powering LED fixtures. It also regulates the current to ensure optimal and safe LED operation.

## üîç Key Considerations When Choosing an LED Power Supply

### 1. Output Voltage vs. Output Current (Constant Voltage vs. Constant Current)

- **Constant Voltage (CV) Drivers**  
  - Used with LEDs designed for a specific voltage (e.g., 12V or 24V)  
  - Ideal for LED strips, linear lights, and architectural runs  
  - Must match the voltage rating of the connected LED load

- **Constant Current (CC) Drivers**  
  - Supply a fixed current (e.g., 350mA, 700mA)  
  - Voltage varies to maintain consistent current  
  - Ideal for high-power LEDs, downlights, or fixtures requiring regulated drive

üîß At Onco Solutions, we perform load calculations to determine whether your lighting configuration demands CV or CC supplies ‚Äì especially critical in large installations.

### 2. Power Rating (Wattage Capacity)

Always choose a PSU with 20‚Äì30% more capacity than the actual load to ensure:

- Better thermal management  
- Longer lifespan  
- Headroom for system expansion  

Example: For a 48W LED load, a 60W PSU offers optimal performance without stress.

### 3. Dimming Compatibility

If you're integrating smart lighting control systems like Dynalite, C-Bus, or DALI, your power supply must support:

- 0‚Äì10V dimming  
- PWM dimming  
- TRIAC or phase-cut dimming  
- DALI/DIGITAL protocols  

Failure to match the dimming protocol with your control system leads to flicker, uneven dimming, or total incompatibility.

### 4. Environmental Factors (IP Rating, Heat Dissipation)

For outdoor, fa√ßade, or wet-area lighting:

- Use IP65/IP67 rated water-resistant power supplies  
- Choose metal enclosures with proper heat sinks for thermal stability  

Onco Solutions only sources power supplies from globally certified brands to ensure durability in Sri Lanka‚Äôs tropical climate conditions.

### 5. Voltage Drop Management

For long LED runs (especially linear installations or outdoor strips), voltage drop becomes a serious concern. We mitigate this by:

- Using higher voltage systems (24V vs. 12V)  
- Incorporating multiple injection points  
- Carefully calculating cable gauge and run length  

Our team at Onco provides full voltage drop assessments during system design.

### 6. Certifications and Protections

Reputable LED power supplies include:

- Overload protection  
- Short-circuit protection  
- Over-voltage and thermal shutdown  
- Certifications like CE, RoHS, UL, TUV, or BIS  

This ensures safety, especially in hospitals, hospitality environments, and public buildings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Onco‚Äôs Engineering Approach

At Onco Solutions, we don‚Äôt guess ‚Äì we engineer.

We:

- Audit your entire lighting load  
- Determine dimming/control requirements  
- Calculate voltage drops  
- Specify high-efficiency, long-lifetime PSUs  
- Ensure physical layout, wiring, and thermal management are aligned with international best practices

## üèÜ Preferred Applications

- **Architectural lighting (linear, cove, fa√ßade):** Requires stable CV PSUs  
- **Boardroom & hotel dimming:** Needs DALI-compliant,
